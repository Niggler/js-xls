DRAFTPROPOSALTOLAKELAND ELECTRIC BYENRON NORTH AMERICA CORP.(Revised September 28, 1999)BUYER:	Lakeland Electric (“Lakeland”)SELLER:	Enron North America Corp. (“ENA”)SCOPE OF AGREEMENTENA proposes to provide: (1) a competitively priced delivered Firm Gas Supply to Lakeland’s 360 MW Westinghouse combined-cycle “501-G” installation at the McIntosh Plant (“McIntosh Plant”), (2) a Supplemental Gas Supply, as needed by Lakeland, and (3)  a Nominating and Scheduling Service. TERM OF AGREEMENTThe term of the agreement would begin on the effective date of the agreement, and would extend until fifteen (15) years after June 1, 2001.  Initially under the agreement, ENA would perform gas nominating and scheduling services, and Supplemental Gas Supply services.  The Firm Gas Supply would start June 1, 2001, with the conversion to combined cycle operations, and extend fifteen years.  The term of the agreement would extend year to year thereafter, unless either party provides one (1) year prior written notice of termination.QUANTITYThe Maximum Daily Quantity (“MaxDQ”) under the agreement would be 100,000 MMBtu per day.  62,000 MMBtu per day would be the Firm Gas Supply quantities (“Firm MaxDQ”).  38,000 MMBtu per day would be the Supplemental Gas Supply quantities (“Supplemental MaxDQ”).  The Firm MaxDQ and the Supplemental MaxDQ are further defined in Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4. The Firm MaxDQ would be scheduled each day by ENA for Lakeland unless Lakeland elects to exercise its option under the Buy Back provision herein, or unless ENA elects to exercise its option under the  Recall of Delivered Gas Supply provision herein.  The MaxDQ will increase in the future to 110,000 MMBtu/day and the Firm MaxDQ will increase in the future to 72,000 MMBtu per day, coincident with start up of operations of the ANR Pipeline capacity if Lakeland has elected to exercise its option under the ANR Incremental Transportation Capacity  provision herein.The Supplemental MaxDQ would be requested by Lakeland on a day ahead basis for any day in which such gas might be needed by Lakeland.  Upon Lakeland’s request, ENA would propose available quantities, pricing, and timing.  Lakeland would accept or reject all or a portion of the quantity proposed as Lakeland’s fuel and power economics dictate. The quantity ultimately agreed to between the parties would be a firm obligation of the parties.Table 1 :  Firm MaxDQ during Combined-Cycle Term(FGT Transportation Only)MonthAssigned FTS-1 (MMBtu/d)AssignedFTS-2 (MMBtu/d)Incremental Firm Volumes (MMBtu/d)FirmMaxDQ (MMBtu/d)January11,48513,44437,07162,000February11,48513,44437,07162,000March3,26120,94437,79562,000April7,67222,63631,69262,000May8,30620,22333,47162,000June8,30620,22333,47162,000July8,30620,22333,47162,000August8,30620,22333,47162,000September8,30620,22333,47162,000October9,95220,94831,10062,000November17,72413,44430,83262,000December11,48513,44437,07162,000Table 2 :  Firm MaxDQ during Combined-Cycle Term (With FGT & ANR Transportation)MonthDesignee Status FTS-1 (MMBtu/d)Designee Status ANR Firm(MMBtu/d)Incremental Firm Volumes (MMBtu/d)FirmMaxDQ (MMBtu/d)January11,48530,00030,51572,000February11,48530,00030,51572,000March3,26130,00038,73972,000April7,67230,00034,32872,000May8,30630,00033,69472,000June8,30630,00033,69472,000July8,30630,00033,69472,000August8,30630,00033,69472,000September8,30630,00033,69472,000October9,95230,00032,04872,000November17,72430,00024,27672,000December11,48530,00030,51572,000Table 3:  Firm and Supplemental MaxDQ(FGT Transportation Only)MonthSupplemental MaxDQMMBtu/d)FirmMaxDQ (MMBtu/d)MaxDQ (MMBtu/d)January38,00062,000100,000February38,00062,000100,000March38,00062,000100,000April38,00062,000100,000May38,00062,000100,000June38,00062,000100,000July38,00062,000100,000August38,00062,000100,000September38,00062,000100,000October38,00062,000100,000November38,00062,000100,000December38,00062,000100,000Table 4:  Firm and Supplemental MaxDQ(With FGT & ANR  Transportation)MonthSupplemental MaxDQMMBtu/d)FirmMaxDQ (MMBtu/d)MaxDQ (MMBtu/d)January38,00072,000110,000February38,00072,000110,000March38,00072,000110,000April38,00072,000110,000May38,00072,000110,000June38,00072,000110,000July38,00072,000110,000August38,00072,000110,000September38,00072,000110,000October38,00072,000110,000November38,00072,000110,000December38,00072,000110,000
DELIVERY POINT(S)The primary delivery point for all deliveries hereunder would be the interconnection between Florida Gas Transmission (“FGT”) and (i) Lakeland - McIntosh Plant, and/or (ii) Lakeland Generating.  The secondary delivery point(s) would be any other Delivery Point(s) on the entire FGT system, subject to limitations by FGT for secondary deliveries. To the extent ANR Pipeline was added to this agreement, the primary delivery point(s) would be revised accordingly.  BUY BACK PROVISIONS“Day Ahead” Buy Back of Gas By providing notice by 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the morning of FGT’s chart time nomination deadline, Lakeland would have the option to request quantities to be delivered less than the Firm MaxDQ.  In such event, ENA would buy back such excess quantities of gas at the price set forth below.“Intraday” Buy Back of GasUpon providing two (2) hours notice prior to FGT’s intraday nomination deadlines for the applicable gas day, Lakeland would have the option to request quantities to be delivered less than the quantities previously scheduled.  In such event, ENA would buy back such excess quantities of gas at the price set forth below.RECALL OF DELIVERED GAS SUPPLYOn a day ahead basis, and as set forth in the Nominations and Scheduling paragraph below, ENA would have the right to recall the gas supply that Lakeland has requested to be scheduled and delivered to its citygate.  At any time that ENA recalls delivered gas supply requested by Lakeland, ENA would buy such Recall Gas at the price set forth below.  In addition, Lakeland has the right to buy back such Recall Gas if needed at the price set forth below.CONTRACT PRICEFirm Gas Supply PriceLakeland would pay ENA a two-part rate consisting of a Monthly Demand Charge and a Commodity Charge (“Contract Price”) as follows:Monthly Demand Charge - Lakeland would pay ENA the sum of (i) the FGT FTS-1 demand charge in effect for any month, times the corresponding Lakeland capacity FTS-1 volumes in Table 1, times the number of days for such month, and (ii) the FGT FTS-2 demand charge in effect for any month, times the sum of the corresponding Lakeland capacity FTS-2 volumes and the Incremental Firm Volumes in Table 1, times the number of days for such month.Commodity Charge - The sum of (i) the first of the month Index as published in Inside F.E.R.C.’s Gas Market Report, (“Index Price”) for all gas delivered in FGT Zone 2, plus (ii) the applicable FTS-1 and FTS-2 variable transport costs (including fuel retention) on FGT, less (iii) a discount for the assigned FTS-1 and FTS-2 volumes of $0.07 per MMBtu, and a discount for the Incremental Firm Volumes of $0.15 per MMBtu ( such discount would not be applicable for quantities under the proposed ANR Pipeline capacity.)Lakeland would have the option to periodically request ENA to modify the Commodity Charge to reflect a price other than the Index Price, such as a fixed price, fixed basis price, floating basis price, Gas Daily price, or any other mutually agreed to pricing structure, as more fully described in ENA’s Master Firm Agreement. Buyback Provision Gas PriceENA would pay Lakeland a fixed price for “Day Ahead” Buyback Gas as mutually agreed to each day, or a default price of the Gas Daily, Citygate, common, low posting for Florida gates via FGT. ENA would pay Lakeland a fixed price for “Intraday” Buyback Gas as mutually agreed to each day, or a default price of the Gas Daily, Citygate, common, low posting for Florida gates via FGT, as posted for the higher of the flowing gas day or the day after the flowing gas day. Recall Provision Gas PriceENA would pay Lakeland for Recall Gas quantities whereby Lakeland would be relieved of its obligation to pay ENA the applicable Contract Price and would receive a credit on the next month’s invoice.  Further, if Lakeland needs to buy back such Recall Gas from ENA, Lakeland would pay ENA an agreed to price each day, which is reflective of current market conditions, or a default price of the Gas Daily, Citygate, common, high posting for Florida gates via FGT. Supplemental Gas Supply PriceLakeland would pay ENA a price for each Supplemental Gas Supply package as periodically agreed to between Lakeland and ENA.NOMINATING AND SCHEDULING SERVICEENA would provide all nominating and scheduling for the Firm Gas Supply and the Supplemental Gas Supply hereunder. Pursuant to this agreement, Lakeland has the right to request ENA to nominate and schedule gas supply from third parties (“Third Party Gas Supply”). There are no additional charges associated with ENA providing such service for Lakeland. TAKE AND DELIVERY OBLIGATIONSLakeland would purchase and take 100% of the gas that it requests each day. ENA would schedule 100% of the gas requested by Lakeland each day.ANR INCREMENTAL TRANSPORTATION CAPACITYTo the extent ANR, or other pipeline companies, constructs a new pipeline (“ANR Pipeline”) into the state of Florida, Lakeland may contract for such incremental firm transportation capacity, and Lakeland would have the option to put such firm capacity to ENA for use by ENA to provide delivered gas supply to Lakeland hereunder.Coincident with start up of operations of such ANR Pipeline capacity, Lakeland will take back from ENA the use of its FGT FTS-2 capacity for use in a separate Lakeland prearranged capacity transaction.Lakeland’s option to put such capacity to ENA would be contingent various competitive factors, including but not limited to the (i) in-service date of the ANR Pipeline is no later than December 31, 2001, (ii) ANR Pipeline demand, commodity charges, fuel retention, and other applicable surcharges, (iii) gas supply pricing and availability on ANR Pipeline, (iv) nominating and scheduling requirements on ANR Pipeline, (v) operating conditions on ANR Pipeline, and (vi) seasonal volume differences between Lakeland’s FGT FTS-2 and ANR Pipeline capacity configurations. NOMINATIONS AND SCHEDULING Lakeland would be responsible for directly requesting its daily gas supply requirements from ENA at or before 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time on the day preceding the gas delivery day. ENA would also be responsible to for notifying Lakeland of its day ahead election to recall such gas supply no later than 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  Both parties may agree from time to time to modify the deadline for nominating to the other party. ENA would be responsible for all nominating and scheduling of gas supply and arranging transport on FGT as part of this agreement. Lakeland and ENA would adhere to GISB standards on nominating, scheduling, etc. ENA would exercise commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate Lakeland regarding intraday scheduling of gas, and related activities.TRANSPORTATION CONTRACT DESIGNEE STATUSTHIS PROPOSAL CONTEMPLATES THAT LAKELAND WOULD AUTHORIZE “DESIGNEE STATUS,” OR OTHER APPLICABLE AGENCY STATUS, FOR ENA TO OPERATE LAKELAND’S EXISTING FGT FTS-1 AND FTS-2 FIRM TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY, AND PROPOSED ANR PIPELINE FIRM TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY. LAKELAND WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXTENDING THE TERM OF SUCH AGREEMENTS AT THE REQUEST OF ENA SHOULD SUCH AGREEMENTS REACH A TERMINATION DATE UPON TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT, ENA “DESIGNEE STATUS” WOULD BE RESCINDED AND WOULD GO BACK TO LAKELAND.
